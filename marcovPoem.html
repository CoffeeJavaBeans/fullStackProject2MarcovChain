An Ode to Sadness 

By Nizar Qabbani, tr. Rachel Schine 

Your love has taught me… how to be sad.
And I have needed, for ages   
A woman to make me sad  
A woman in whose arms I could weep  
Like a sparrow ,
A woman—to gather up my pieces— 
Like shards of shattered crystal 

Your love has taught me, my dear,
The worst of habits 
It has taught me to fill up my glass 
A thousand times per night 
And to sample the treatment of druggists 
To knock at the diviners’ door 
It has taught me— I now leave my home 
To comb the roadside flagstones 
And I stalk your visage 
In the rain, and in the lights of cars 
I stalk your specter 
Even… even… 
In sheets of advertisements… 

Your love has taught me… 
How I’ve been love-lost in my own face—for hours 
Searching for a gypsy poem,
That every gypsy girl might envy 
Searching for a face—a voice—
Your love is all the faces and all the voices.

Your love has made me enter, my dear 
Cities of sorrows 
Before you, I had not entered 
Cities of sorrows—
I had never known— 
That a tear was a person 
That a person without sadness 
Is the memory of a person…

Your love has taught me…
To behave like kids,
To draw your face— 
With chalk upon the walls 
And on the sails of fishermen’s crafts 
Upon the church bells,
And the crosses.
Your love has taught me… 
How love alters the turning of time—
It has taught me that when I love,
The earth holds back its spinning 
Your love has taught me things…
That were never part of the accounting 
So I read the stories of children—
I entered the palaces of the jinn kings 
I dreamed that the daughter of the sultan 
Married me—
Those eyes of hers… purer than the gulf waters 
Those lips of hers… more luscious than a pomegranate’s bloom 
And I dreamed that I safeguarded her 
Like the knights,
I dreamed that I gifted her,
With strands of pearl and coral 
Your love has taught me, my dear, what delirium is 
It has taught me how life goes on,
With the sultan’s daughter never coming. 

Your love has taught me…
How I love you in all things 
In the naked tree 
In the desiccated, yellow leaves 
In the rainy weather—in the storms 
In the smallest of cafes—
In which we, of an evening, drank our black coffee 

Your love has taught me to seek refuge 
In nameless hotels 
In nameless churches 
In nameless cafes 
Your love has taught me…
How the night distends with strangers’ sorrows 
It has taught me… how to see Beirut: 
A woman… a madame of seductions 
A woman, wearing each and every night 
The finest garments she possesses 
Sprinkling perfume on her breasts 
For the sailors—and the princes—
Your love has taught me…  
To weep for lack of crying 
It has taught me how sadness sleeps 
Like a young boy with severed feet 
On the streets of Rūsha and Ḥamrā’ 

Your love has taught me… how to be sad. 
And I have needed, for ages 
A woman to make me sad 
A woman in whose arms I could weep 
Like a sparrow,
A woman— to gather up my pieces— 
Like shards of shattered crystal
